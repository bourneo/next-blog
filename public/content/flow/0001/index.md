## How to disable the Count Badge of Source Control in VS Code

The count badge real disturbs me while I'm coding in VS Code, so I decide to disable it manually.

Search "Count Badge" in settings, change the value of the item, turn it off.

```plantuml title
class SimplePlantUMLPlugin {
    + transform(syntaxTree: AST): AST
}
```

VS Code provides a number of options to customize you editor, it is a user-friendly tool for
developers in this aspect.
